### About me
Creating websites and web applications is my hobby and greatest passion. I've been developing it for almost 2 years. I focus all my attention on enhancing my coding ablilites and learning about new technologies. Experience in sales has helped me to develop effective communication skills, the ability to comprehend and hear others, and the ability to prepare and deliver the outcomes of my sales strategy. Working remotely has impoved my time-management skills. I see myself becomeing a a Fullstack Developer in the nearest future. <br>
Currently, I am developing my own project, which is dedicated to Dirt Rally 2.0, that will allow players rapidly choose the car setup for a rally stage. I constantly face various challenges developing this project, but my persistance and hard working helps me to solve them.
I must admit that it gives me a lot of motivation and joy implementing and developing this project.<br>

## Code example

```

  const found = haystack.find(el => el == "needle");
  
  return `found the ${found} at position ${haystack.indexOf(found)}`;
